# WBOPENDATA: Stata module to access World Bank databases

## Description

wbopendata allows Stata users to download over 16,000 indicators from the World Bank databases, including: Development Africa Development Indicators; Doing Business; Education Statistics; Enterprise Surveys; Global Development Finance;
    Gender Statistics; Health Nutrition and Population Statistics; International Development Association - Results Measurement
    System; Millennium Development Goals; World Development Indicators; Worldwide Governance Indicators; and LAC Equity Lab.
    These indicators include information from over 256 countries and regions, since 1960.

Users can chose from one of three of the languages supported by the database (and Stata), namely, English, Spanish, or French.

Five possible downloads options are currently supported:

- country: over 2,500 indicators for all selected years for a single country (WDI Catalogue).
- topics: WDI indicators within a specific topic, for all selected years and all countries (WDI Catalogue).
- indicator: all selected years for all countries for a single indicator (from any of the catalogues: 16,000+ series).
- indicator and country: all selected years for selected countries for a single indicator (from any of the catalogues: 16,000+ series).
- multiple indicator: all selected years for selected indicators separated by ; (from any of the catalogues: 16,000+ series).

Users can also choose to have the data displayed in either the wide or long format (wide is the default option).  Note that the reshape is the local machine, so it will require the appropriate amount of RAM to work properly.

wbopendata draws from the main World Bank collections of development indicators, compiled from officially-recognized international sources. It presents the most current and accurate global development data available, and includes national, regional and global estimates.

The access to this databases is made possible by the World Bank's Open Data Initiative which provide open full access to [World Bank databases](http://data.worldbank.org/).
